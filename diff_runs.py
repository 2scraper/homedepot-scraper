diff_runs.py
-------------
Compares two output files from this project (JSON, as written by
output_writer.save) and reports what changed between them, keyed on `sku`.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old homedepot_products.2026-09-01.json \\
                          --new homedepot_products.2026-09-08.json

Typical use is a scheduled re-run of one category, kept under a dated
filename and diffed against the previous one to track price moves,
restocks and delistings.

Five buckets, each keyed on sku:

  added          — sku present in --new, absent from --old
  removed        — sku present in --old, absent from --new (delisted, or
                   just off this particular listing)
  changed        — sku in both, with a different tracked field
  source_changed — sku in both, whose price differs AND whose
                   `price_source` differs. Reported separately and ignored
                   by --fail-on-change, because it says something about our
                   own two readings, not about the site. See below.
  unmatched      — a row this project's parser could not recover a sku for,
                   counted rather than folded into added/removed

Why `source_changed` exists here when the a sibling repo sibling has no such
bucket: this site has FOUR ways of stating a price and they are not equally
trustworthy — a tile's microdata, a gift-set tile's bare text, a product
page's JSON-LD, and a product page's rendered price (see
output_writer.Product.price_source). A category run and a product run of the
same sku therefore read the same price through different instruments, and
so do two category runs if the site changes a tile from a set-price block to
a normal one. Reporting that as a price change would be reporting our own
instrument, which is exactly the false "price changed" CLAUDE.md §8 forbids.

There is no `--price-tolerance-pct`: every row of one run comes from one
locale and therefore one currency (`price` and `currency` are read together
from the same node), so there is no exchange-rate tick to absorb. A price on
this site moves in whole currency units, not continuously.

A run against a showcase locale (`int/en`, `ru`) has `price=None` on every
row. Diffing two of those is legitimate and reports title, availability and
delisting changes; it will simply never report a price change, because the
site publishes none.

    #                      the image moving.
    #   `scraped_at`     — the clock, not the catalogue.
    #   `page`/`row_index` — a row's position inside a payload. Measured
    #                      2026-09-20: two runs of one category twenty
    #                      minutes apart produced identical rows with 44 of
    #                      131 row_index values changed, because the grid
    #                      reordered. Tracking it would report every such
    #                      run as 44 changes and nothing real.
    #   `color_name`/`size_name` — part of the SKU's identity, not a
    #                      property that changes under it. If one of them
    #                      changed for a given `sku`, the right report is
    #                      that the site reused an id, which is a different
    #                      and louder event than a field edit.
    #   `related_categories` — merchandising. A product moving between
    #                      collections is not a change to the product.
