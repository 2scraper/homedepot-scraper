page_flow.py
------------
homedepot.com's page-state policy and readiness anchors, shared by all
three engines.

Two modes, and only one of them has anything to wait for:

    category   a listing page. Server-rendered in full on the first
               response — the tiles, their prices and their ids are all in
               the bytes a plain `curl` returns (measured 2026-09-17/18 on
               20 captures, 317 tiles, none of them added by script). The
               readiness anchor therefore confirms the GRID arrived, it does
               not wait out a hydration step.
    product    one product page. Likewise server-rendered, including the
               JSON-LD block that carries the price.

Why there is no pagination wait here
------------------------------------
There is no page 2 to wait for. This site's listing paging is a sibling repo platform's
`?start=N&sz=25`, requested by a "show more" control, and robots.txt
disallows both parameters (`*?start=*`, `*sz*`) — so `product_parser.
page_url` returns its input unchanged and a listing run is one fetch. See
that function's comment for what covers a whole locale instead.

That makes CLAUDE.md §7's layer 3 — "this page added no new sku" — the only
terminating condition in play, which is the layer the family trusts most: a
missing link is a property of markup, an exhausted listing is a property of
the catalogue.

What a page can answer
----------------------
    content    parse it
    blocked    a network- or vendor-level refusal before any content arrived
    captcha    a challenge widget — the paid path
    empty      a real page with nothing to parse on it. NOT hypothetical
               here and NOT a fault: `/es/.../sets/` and `/it/.../sets/` are
               both served, both 200, and both list zero products (measured
               2026-09-17). Report it, do not retry it, and do not go
               looking for a proxy problem.

Three copies of that triage would drift, exactly as this family's other
repos found.

The functions here are either pure or driven through small callables, so
each engine passes its own driver's primitives — no JavaScript crosses this
boundary, which is what keeps a site whose CSP lacks `unsafe-eval` from
turning a readiness wait into a crash.

# What "the page has painted" means, per mode. Both modes are server-rendered

# anchors exist to confirm the right grid/page arrived, not to wait out a
# hydration step.
#
# There is no product to wait for. Measured 2026-09-19, a fully rendered
# `/gb/women.html` (938,454 bytes) contains 0 product ids, 0 grid classes and
# 0 JSON-LD blocks — the grid is fetched as JSON after load and this repo
# fetches that JSON itself.
#
# So readiness here means "the storefront is up and the session exists",
# which is all a browser engine needs before it starts issuing same-origin
# API calls. The anchors are the two things a served Home Depot page always has
# and a challenge page never does: the `var inditex={...}` configuration blob
# and a link to the static asset host. Both are confirmed by
# `product_parser.detect_page_state`, which is what the engines actually

    browser a STRING to evaluate, which a site whose CSP lacks `unsafe-eval`
    refuses outright -- on a sibling repo (tokopedia-scraper) that was an
    `EvalError` and exit 1 on the site's most obvious URL, reproducing on one
    of its two listing routes and not the other, because the two are served
    by different renderers with different headers.

    in when a header changes. `querySelectorAll` through the protocol is a
    CDP call, works under any CSP, and spells the same in all three drivers
    -- which is why all three `_driver()` adapters already expose `count`.

    `count` is expected to swallow its own driver errors and return 0: this

    The wait condition is POSITIVE: it waits for `detect_page_state` to say

    simply exposed a second path for the same listing, not changed the
